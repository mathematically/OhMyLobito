# Oh My Lobito

A minimal prompt for Oh My Posh. No Powerline styling, no time, no multiline or right justified shenanigens. 

* Format is '-> directory (branch)'.
* Shows only the tail of the current directory.
* In git repositories shows the current branch in brackets.
	* If no changes the name will be the same colour as the brackets.
	* If there are working or staged changes the branch name will be red.
	* If ahead or behind the remote, the branch name will be purple.
* Colours are from the Tokyo Night terminal theme.

I.e. it's just the things I found actually useful from other themes with a colour scheme that matches my terminal setup.
