# Oh My Lobito

A minimal prompt for Oh My Posh with just the features I actually use.

* Format is '-> directory (branch)'.
* (branch) is only shown in git repositories:
	* If no changes the name will be the same colour as the brackets.
	* If there are working or staged changes the branch name will be red.
	* If ahead or behind the remote, the branch name will be purple.
* -> shows return code of last command, green = ok, red = error.
* Colours are from the Tokyo Night terminal theme.
